## Athanasios Zagkliveris - Junior Data Analyst

Hi! I'm Athanasios Zagkliveris, but you can call me Thanos. I'm a Junior Data Analyst currently working on data analysis projects to develop my skills and knowledge in this field.

This GitHub repository serves as a space for me to:

* Showcase my projects
* Document my learnings
* Collaborate with others (open to collaboration opportunities!)

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. Feel free to reach out if you have any projects or questions!
